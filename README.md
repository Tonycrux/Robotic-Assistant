USER GUIDE

Project: Development of a Robotic Assistant for Object Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network

Author: Oluyele Sunday Anthony

1. Power Raspberry by plugging in USB on board
2. Object recogntion works immediately on boot
3. Power DC motors by fixing up 1.5V batteries to work
4. Connect the Raspberry to nearby wifi
5. Make sure the device for connection is connected to the same network
5. On your device browser go to 192.168.43.84/earthrover/ to access the remote for the robotic assistant
6. Put on/off the range sensor if desired.
7. To shutdown, remove the raspberry from power through the usb port.
8. Disconnect the dc motors as well from the power source.
